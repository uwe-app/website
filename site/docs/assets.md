Assets give us a hint that certain files are global assets for the site; all you need to do is put the files in an `assets` folder.

These files are logos, stylesheets, fonts, scripts, icons and any other files that you use across all pages.

Using the `assets` folder convention is completely optional but it will help us do the right thing when live reload is enabled.

If you prefer another name then you can change it in [settings]({{ link "/docs/settings/" }}).
