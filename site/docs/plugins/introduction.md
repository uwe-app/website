# Introduction

Plugins allow us to share styles, scripts, assets and other files between projects.

They are primarily designed to let us share page layouts and partials which we can re-use across multiple projects but they have been designed to allow for complex *formats* to also be created.

We wanted the design to be flexible enough that you can share fonts, styles, icons or any other file using the plugin system but also easy to create and consume plugins.
