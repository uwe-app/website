To uninstall the platform tools remove the `.uwe` directory in your home folder (`$HOME`).

The version manager has an `uninstall` command which will remove the folder:

```text
uvm uninstall
```

When prompted type `y` to confirm you want to uninstall the program and all it's components. If you decide to uninstall we would appreciate it if you could let us know why in the [community discussions](https://github.com/uwe-app/community/discussions) or on [discord][].

Any websites you have created will not be deleted and you should remove them manually.
