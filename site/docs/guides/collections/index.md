{{import "header"}}

Collections let us inject data into page templates by loading the data assigned to pages or from a folder of files.

Use collections to load from data providers, create indices and define queries that are assigned to page templates and perform more advanced tasks like generating *synthetic pages* for each document in a collection or paginating large collections.

If you want to dive straight in take a look at the [site settings][blog-site-settings] for the [blog blueprint][blog-blueprint] or read more in this section which looks in detail at how to create and use collections.

{{#>alert}}
The term *synthetic* is used to refer to generated pages that do not have a corresponding source file.
